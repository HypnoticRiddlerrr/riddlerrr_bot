"""
This module defines a cog for handling specific channel interactions and events for a Twitch bot.

The FunChannelCommands cog includes event handlers and commands that interact with the
Twitch channel in fun and engaging ways. Currently, it includes functionality for responding
to custom channel point rewards by presenting riddles to viewers.

Classes:
    FunChannelCommands(commands.Cog): A cog that includes event handling for messages and
    commands for fetching and presenting riddles.

Functions:
    prepare(bot: commands.Bot) -> None:
        Adds the FunChannelCommands cog to the bot instance.

Usage:
    Load this cog in your main bot file to add channel-specific interaction commands to your bot's
    functionality. Example:

    bot.load_module('cogs.fun_channel_commands')
